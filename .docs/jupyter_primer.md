# Jupyter Notebook Primer

## What is a Jupyter Notebook?

A Jupyter Notebook is an interactive computing environment that allows you to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It's widely used for data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.

## Key Components

*   **Cells**: Notebooks are composed of cells. The two main types are:
    *   **Code Cells**: Contain code to be executed by the kernel. The output of the execution is displayed below the cell.
    *   **Markdown Cells**: Contain text formatted using Markdown, including headings, lists, links, images, and LaTeX equations.
*   **Kernel**: The computational engine that executes the code contained in a notebook document. When you open a notebook, it connects to a kernel (e.g., Python, R, Julia). Each notebook typically has one kernel.
*   **Notebook Document**: A file (with `.ipynb` extension) that contains both the content (code, markdown) and the metadata (kernel information, cell execution results).

## How to Use

1.  **Launch Jupyter**: You typically start JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook from your terminal.
2.  **Create or Open**: Create a new notebook or open an existing `.ipynb` file.
3.  **Write Code/Text**: Add code or markdown text into cells.
4.  **Run Cells**: Execute cells individually or run all cells. For code cells, the output appears beneath the cell.
5.  **Save**: Save your notebook, which stores the code, text, and output.

## Common Use Cases

*   Data exploration and analysis
*   Building and training machine learning models
*   Creating visualizations
*   Writing tutorials and documentation
*   Prototyping code

## Tips

*   Use Markdown cells to explain your code and thought process.
*   Break down long code into smaller, logical cells.
*   Restart the kernel and run all cells to ensure reproducibility.
*   Explore extensions for added functionality.
